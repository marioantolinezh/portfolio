### Motivation
In an aim to contribute to the progress and welfare of society, the crop of knowledge and the yield of quality services.  

### Working Experience
## 2. Cybersecurity Internship at Seresco, 2022
After comming from the US I decided to work in Spain for some months, and I got the opportunity to work in a company from my city, Oviedo, which is offers IT services and consulting, Seresco. I was with the Cybersecurity group and my responsibilities were to analyse the characteristics and  vulnerabilities of a small OT (Operations Technologies, or Industry-oriented IT) simulated environment, which was formed by different PLCs and some other network components. This gave me the opportunity to get to know the dynamics of a working team and to learn how companies work from inside. 

## 1. Research assistant in a university project, 2021
In the time I was studing in the US, at CWRU, I had the opportunity to start working with [PhD Kenneth Loparo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_A._Loparo) and another professor in a project that pursued correlating SpO2 variation with Heart Rate variability and activity by using Machine Learning techniques and algorithms. We mainly worked with Matlab and various databases from real patients. This was to me a great opportunity to dive in the investigation working environments, which I had not the opportunity to get to know until that time. We continued working when I got back, but after not seeing progress in our initial hypothesis we stopped. 


### Projects
## 5. TFG, Una teoría cuántica de la luz, 2022 (currently)
Actualmente estoy trabajando en el Trabajo de Fin de Grado, que he decidido hacer en el área de la teoría cuántica de la luz. El fin es generar unos estados coherentes de la luz en el vacío (Estados de Fock) mediante simulaciones con Matlab.

## 4. [Implementing Quantum Bayesian Neural Networks, 2022](https://github.com/marioantolinezh/)
The final project for the Quantum Computing Course was designing an implementation for any of the course topics. The group was to multi-disciplinary in order to work on the different (mathematica, physical, computer-science and engineering) aproach of the problem. We chose to implement a Bayesian Neurlal Network to explore the potential of Quantum Machine Learning techinques.

## 3. [Designing a Quantum Random Number Generator, 2022](https://github.com/marioantolinezh/QRNG)
As part of the subject Data Privacy group project we decided to build a True Random Number Geberator based making use of Quantum Physics uncertain outcomes based on IMB's Quantum Lab which we used togeather with Qiskit and Python. In the project we also performed statistical test that could proof the advantage of QRNG over other random numbers generators such as random() or os.urandom() libraries, which are both Pseudo-Random Number Generators as both relay on mathematical complex functions although the second one is considered a True RNG as it uses undeterministic masurements -such as CPU noise- as seed values. 

## 2. [ML for Cardiac Rearest Prediction, 2021](https://github.com/marioantolinezh/Cardiac-Rearrests-Prediction-Using-HRV-and-ML-Algorithms)
The aim of this project carried on in the Bioelectric Phenomena Graduate course was to investigate the accuracy of various Machine Learning techniques to predict Cardiac Rearests based on Heart Rate Variability parameters over real provided datasets. 
The result was [...]

## 1. [Leveraging EEG signals to determine atention, 2021](https://github.com/marioantolinezh/leveragin-EEG-signals-to-determine-atention)
I participated in a group Senior Capstone Project in which we designed and built a portable and low-cost electroencephalogram -based on an Arduino- which aimed leveraging the signals comming from the brain (in particular the Alpha Frequency Band) to perform analysis on the rate of change of attention of the user as we had observed from a Literature Research, consisting on building several filters to obtain the desired frequency band on which we performed differential measurements.

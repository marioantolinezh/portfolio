### Projects
## 5. [TFG, Una teoría cuántica de la luz, 2022]
Actualmente estoy trabajando en el Trabajo de Fin de Grado, que he decidido hacer en el área de la teoría cuántica de la luz. El fin es generar unos estados coherentes de la luz en el vacío (Estados de Fock) mediante simulaciones con Matlab.

## 4. [Implementing Quantum Bayesian Neural Networks, 2022](https://github.com/marioantolinezh/)
The final project for the Quantum Computing Course was designing an implementation for any of the course topics. The group was to multi-disciplinary in order to work on the different (mathematica, physical, computer-science and engineering) aproach of the problem. We chose to implement a Bayesian Neurlal Network to explore the potential of Quantum Machine Learning techinques.

## 3. [Designing a Quantum Random Number Generator, 2022](https://github.com/marioantolinezh/QRNG)
As part of the subject Data Privacy group project we decided to build a True Random Number Geberator based making use of Quantum Physics uncertain outcomes based on IMB's Quantum Lab which we used togeather with Qiskit and Python. In the project we also performed statistical test that could proof the advantage of QRNG over other random numbers generators such as random() or os.urandom() libraries, which are both Pseudo-Random Number Generators as both relay on mathematical complex functions although the second one is considered a True RNG as it uses undeterministic masurements -such as CPU noise- as seed values. 

## 2. [ML for Cardiac Rearest Prediction, 2021](https://github.com/marioantolinezh/Cardiac-Rearrests-Prediction-Using-HRV-and-ML-Algorithms)
The aim of this project carried on in the Bioelectric Phenomena Graduate course was to investigate the accuracy of various Machine Learning techniques to predict Cardiac Rearests based on Heart Rate Variability parameters over real provided datasets. 
The result was [...]

## 1. [Leveraging EEG signals to determine atention, 2021](https://github.com/marioantolinezh/leveragin-EEG-signals-to-determine-atention)
I participated in a group Senior Capstone Project in which we designed and built a portable and low-cost electroencephalogram -based on an Arduino- which aimed leveraging the signals comming from the brain (in particular the Alpha Frequency Band) to perform analysis on the rate of change of attention of the user as we had observed from a Literature Research, consisting on building several filters to obtain the desired frequency band on which we performed differential measurements.
